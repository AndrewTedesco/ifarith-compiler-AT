Kris doesn't give good information for building the programs with linux, at least if you are using WSL

done in steps:

racket compiler.rkt -v test-programs/__.ifa
nasm -felf64 test-programs/__.asm
ld test-programs/__.o -o test-programs/__ -lc -I/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2


done on a single line:

racket compiler.rkt -v test-programs/__.ifa && nasm -felf64 test-programs/__.asm && ld test-programs/__.o -o test-programs/__ -lc -I/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2


the -lc tells the linker to include the standard library (has functions like printf). I don't know what the -I stuff does, but it is important because otherwise things don't work.
